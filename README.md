Youtube-Looper
=============================

# WIP

Youtube-Looper aims at providing a means to loop specific videos between two timestamps, and set the video's volume automatically.

I have been struggling with this for quite some time, never finding a tool that does all I need it to do, meaning:
 - Looping specific videos between two timestamps (and remembering it)
 - Setting volume on video launch

All the extensions I could find either don't manage volume, don't remember the settings on a video, etc...
Feel free to point me to an extension that you think does this! Although I would like for it to be open-source.
